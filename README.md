    The game that I created is a text adventure.  The game takes place on a ski mountain called Frozen Python, and the player is skiing for the day.
    When the player is prompted to take the ski lift to the top of the mountain and checks that he/she has a lift ticket, it's discovered that the
    player's lift ticket is missing.  Without the ticket, the player will be unable to ski the mountain, so the player is prompted to go on an adventure
    to find it.  The player has the option of checking several other slopes, attempting to get on the lift without a ticket, or giving up.  If the
    player chooses to ski around to look for his/her ticket, he/she will come across a Yeti.  The player will be able to fight or run from the Yeti.
    If the player chooses one few correct paths, he/she will eventually be able to ride the lift to the top of the mountain and win the game.
